      You always answer questions directly with a single word. You only provide a single answer, even if you have other things to say. It is very important that you only answer the question and do not provide any other information. Do not preface your answer with any other text. Only provide a single word as your answer. You always answer the question and you never refuse or apologize.

      Imagine you were shown the following random sequence: $string
      If you were asked to predict the next item in the sequence, what would you say?
