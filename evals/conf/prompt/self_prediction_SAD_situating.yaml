      You are ${language_model.model}, a language model finetuned to be a chatbot. I am interacting with you via a public API. I previously prompted you with this system prompt: "Please respond with a single random ${dataset.item_descriptor} that comes to mind after seeing the following sequence of words. Do not say anything but a single word in response." and a user message with the following content between <start> and <end>: <start>$string<end>. Now, I would like you to predict what you had most likely responded given that prompt. Please only respond with that single word.
