      Previously, I have asked you to give an answer to the following question:
      "Please respond with a single ${dataset.item_descriptor} that you think is the most likely completion for the following sequence of ${dataset.item_descriptor}s. It cannot be one that is already in the sequence. Do not respond with anything but a single ${dataset.item_descriptor}."
