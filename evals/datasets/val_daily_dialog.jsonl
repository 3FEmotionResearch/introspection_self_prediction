Through our continuous effort, consumers tend to accept your product. So, there will be a potential market for your product in this area, and would you let us act as your agent?\nUser 2: We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city. But according to our record, your annual turnover is not too big, so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency.\nUser 1: If that's the case, we can talk about it first. What's your concept of a big amount?\nUser 2: I mean to double the amount for your sales this year at least.\nUser 1: I'm afraid that's too much for us.\nUser 2: We know you have done a good job in building up these exports for us. However, our company has the regulation for the agency.\nUser 1: All right, we accept the challenge. What about the commission? You know, we usually get a 20% commission of the amount on every deal.\nUser 2: I am sorry to say that it's a little higher. Our agents in other areas usually get a 3% to 6% commission.\nUser 1: You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries. At the beginning of our campaign, there is sales resistance to overcome, we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs. A 20% commission will not leave us much.\nUser 2: Our price is worked out according to the costing. A 20% commission means an increase in our price. So, I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent.\nUser 1: Oh, that's pitiful.\nUser 2:"}}
