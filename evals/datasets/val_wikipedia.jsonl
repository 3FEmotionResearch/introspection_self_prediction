{"title": "Marine protected areas of South Africa", "content": "The marine protected areas of South Africa are in an area of coastline or ocean within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Republic of South Africa that is protected in terms of specific legislation for the benefit of the environment and the people who live in and use it. An MPA is a place where marine life can thrive under less pressure than unprotected areas. They are like underwater parks, and this healthy environment can benefit neighbouring areas.There are a total of 42 marine protected areas in the South African EEZ, after consolidation, with a total area of 15.5% of its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The target was to have 10% of the oceanic waters protected by 2020. All but one of the MPAs are in the exclusive economic zone off continental South Africa, and one is off the Prince Edward Islands in the Southern Ocean. Without the large Prince Edward Islands MPA, South Africa has 41 MPAs covering 5.4% of its continental EEZ. This achieves United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14.5 for conservation of marine and coastal areas, and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\u20132020 Aichi Target 11.People can take part in a wide range of non-consumptive activities in all of South Africa's MPAs, and some parts of some MPAs are zoned for limited consumptive activities. Some of these activities require a permit, which is a form of taxation."}

{"title": "Douglas Dunlop", "content": "Douglas Dunlop was a Scottish teacher and missionary who, during the British occupation of Egypt (1888\u20131922), controversially created what became known as the 'Dunlop-system' in Egyptian education. He was widely seen as an opponent of Egyptian nationalist aspirations in education.\nFrom 1882 to 1922, Egypt was under British military occupation, and its government heavily under the influence (control) of the British Empire. The first Consul-General, Sir Evelyn Baring (later 1st Earl of Cromer), appointed Dunlop as British 'consultant' to the Egyptian Ministry of Education. Dunlop was suggested for this task by Cromer's former tennis partner.\nDunlop and the British had two concerns. Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant) educated governing class and civil service, modelled on their experiences in British India. The education policy of the Egyptian government prior to the occupation had been to create a meritocratic system. Dunlop, on the other hand, oversaw the creation of an elitist two-tier system, with fees introduced for the elite schools. Modernisation also occurred, with elemental schooling being both centralised and expanded.\nPrior to the British occupation, the administrative languages of Egypt had been French and Turkish. With British influence, English became the preferred language. This brought increasing controversy, as Egyptian nationalists sought to reassert Arabic. Dunlop, even after thirty years in Egypt, like Cromer, did not speak Arabic. He primarily promoted teaching in English, preferring to employ British teachers and attempting to marginalise teaching in Arabic and French.\nIn 1907, Saad Zaghlul (later revolutionary leader and post-independence prime minister) became Minister of Education. Zaghul strongly promoted Arabic in education, and necessarily locking horns with his British advisor. Dunlop became a figure associated with British resistance to Egyptian anti-colonialism. Dunlop resigned his post during the Egyptian revolution of 1919."}

At the age of 15, Smith joined the Argyle Theatre Touring Company where acting assignments included a stint as an ugly sister in a production of Cinderella. After working as an office boy for Bernard Delfont, and an talent agent for MVA and the Billy Marsh Agency, Smith formed his own talent agency based out of London's Golden Square.In the late sixties Smith worked as a production associate on two documentary shorts made by Norcon films, Brendan Behan's Dublin (1966) and The London Nobody Knows (1967) beginning a long association and friendship with their director Norman Cohen (1936\u20131983). With Smith producing and Cohen directing, the two men would go on to make the film adaptation of Spike Milligan's Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall (1973). Smith followed this with the Confessions... series of sex comedy films, with Michael Klinger as the executive producer and Cohen directing all but the first. The series comprises Confessions of a Window Cleaner (directed by Val Guest, 1974), Confessions of a Pop Performer (1975), Confessions of a Driving Instructor (1976) and lastly Confessions from a Holiday Camp (1977). The Confessions series put Smith and Cohen in direct competition with the Carry On series of films. \"Things have changed since the Carry-Ons\" Smith remarked to Films Illustrated in September 1975: \"Humour is more sophisticated, people are more aware. Not that I'm running down the Carry-Ons for one moment. They're one of my favourite types of film, and always have been. But maybe they're a little dated now.\"A commercial, but diverse, filmmaker, Smith's other work from this period included producing the glam rock extravaganza Never Too Young to Rock (1976), the documentary  The Importance of Being Dublin (1974) and the third film  adaptation of The Thirty-Nine Steps (1978). Plans for a 1978 film adaptation of Dennis Potter's Pennies from Heaven (meant to have been produced by Smith for Norfolk International Productions) did not come to fruition, however, nor did plans to make a fifth Confessions film \u2018Confessions from a Haunted House\u2019 in 1978.Smith began turning more to producing for television, including the well-remembered Shillingbury Tales (1980), working in the field until the late 1990s.

{"title": "Phenol coefficient", "content": "The Phenol coefficient, is now largely of historical interest, although the principles upon which it is based are still used.  It is a measure of the bactericidal activity of a chemical compound in relation to phenol. When listed numerically, the figure expressing the disinfecting power of a substance by relating it to the disinfecting power of phenol may be a function of the standardized test performed.  For example, the Rideal\u2013Walker method, introduced in 1903 gives a Rideal\u2013Walker coefficient and the U.S. Department of Agriculture method gives a U.S. Department of Agriculture coefficient.\nTo calculate phenol coefficient, the concentration of phenol at which the compound kills the test organism in 10 minutes, but not in 5 minutes, is divided by the concentration of the test compound that kills the organism under the same conditions (or, probably more common, dividing the dilution factor at which the tested substance shows activity by the dilution factor at which phenol shows comparable activity). The Rideal\u2013Walker test was widely used, but the test conditions chosen were unrealistic, and impossibly high values for the coefficient were claimed by disinfectant manufacturers. Distinguished bacteriologist Sir Ashley Miles, reviewing the subject, described the test as \"...at best a grossly over-simplified answer to a difficult problem and, at worst little short of bacteriological prostitution\".  Modifications were made by Dame Harriette Chick and Sir Charles James Martin in 1908. They used more realistic conditions, including 3% sterile faeces to mimic the conditions in which many disinfectants were used. The Chick\u2013Martin test was then widely used until replaced by more suitable tests not reliant on phenol and reflecting the conditions  in which modern disinfectants are used.Calculations by Harriette Chick showed that the killing of bacteria by disinfectants followed first order kinetics. So, the bactericidal activity of a particular disinfectant at a given concentration can be expressed as a constant (k) calculated by employing the formula k = N/C\u00b7T where N is the number of surviving cells, C is the concentration of agent applied and T is the time for which the agent is applied, so k is inversely proportional to dose (C\u00b7T is collectively called dose). \nOne way to compare disinfectants is to compare how well they do against a known disinfectant and rate them accordingly using the Phenol coefficient. The disinfectant to be tested is compared with phenol on a standard microbe (usually Salmonella typhi or Staphylococcus aureus). Disinfectants that are more effective than phenol have a coefficient greater than 1; those that are less effective have a coefficient less than 1."}

{"title": "Animal unit", "content": "The concept of an animal unit (AU) has traditionally been used in North America to facilitate planning, analysis and administration of forage use by grazing livestock, but the term has also had other applications (in relation to odor control regulation, feedlot size, manure management, etc.).  The term has been variously defined by regulation in different jurisdictions, and by livestock management specialists, rangeland resource managers and others.  Consequently, when using or interpreting the term, care is needed to ensure that a definition appropriate for the purpose is being used.  Most (but not all) definitions are based on the concept that a 1000-pound (454 kg) cow, with or without an unweaned calf, is one animal unit, with such a cow being assumed to consume 26 pounds (about 12 kg) of forage dry matter per day.\nAnimal unit months (AUMs) in a grazing area (calculated by multiplying the number of animal units by the number of months of grazing) provide a useful indicator of the amount of forage consumed.   On public lands in various jurisdictions, authorized use of forage for grazing is commonly expressed in animal unit months."}

Brighton and Hove was granted city status in 2000 after being designated a unitary authority three years earlier through the merger of the fashionable, long-established seaside resort of Brighton and the mostly Victorian residential town of Hove. In both towns, and in surrounding villages and suburbs, a wide range of Christian churches were established\u2014mostly in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  More than 150 of these survive (although not all are still in religious use), but demolition and the redevelopment of sites for residential and commercial use has been happening since the 1920s.  Postwar trends of declining church attendance and increasing demands for land accelerated the closure and destruction of church buildings: many demolitions were carried out in the 1950s and 1960s, and five churches were lost in 1965 alone.  Although most of these buildings dated from the urban area's strongest period of growth in the 19th century, some newer churches have also been lost: one survived just 20 years."}

{"title": "Eusociality", "content": "Eusociality (from Greek \u03b5\u1f56 eu \"good\" and social), the highest level of organization of sociality, is defined by the following characteristics: cooperative brood care (including care of offspring from other individuals), overlapping generations within a colony of adults, and a division of labor into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. The division of labor creates specialized behavioral groups within an animal society which are sometimes referred to as 'castes'. Eusociality is distinguished from all other social systems because individuals of at least one caste usually lose the ability to perform at least one behavior characteristic of individuals in another caste. Eusocial colonies can be viewed as superorganisms.\nEusociality has evolved among the insects, crustaceans, and mammals. It is most widespread in the Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps) and in Blattodea (termites). A colony has caste differences: queens and reproductive males take the roles of the sole reproducers, while soldiers and workers work together to create a living situation favorable for the brood. Queens produce multiple queen pheromones to create and maintain the eusocial state in their colonies; they may also eat eggs laid by other females or exert dominance by fighting. There are two eusocial vertebrates among rodents: the naked mole-rat and the Damaraland mole-rat. Some shrimp, such as Synalpheus regalis, are eusocial. E. O. Wilson and others have made the claim that humans have evolved a weak form of eusociality. It has been suggested that the colonial and epiphytic staghorn fern, too, may make use of a primitively eusocial division of labor.\n\n"}

His role was mainly as a back-up, first to Whitey McDonald, then also remaining in reserve in 1937\u201338 when an unsuccessful experiment was made to install Alex Winning in the position, resulting in the signing of Jock Shaw who became a mainstay of the team. Cheyne took part sufficient matches (17) in 1936\u201337 to be awarded a Scottish Football League winner's medal (in the club's three other title wins during his time at Ibrox he made only three, six and two appearances respectively) and played in the 1936 Scottish Cup Final in which the Gers defeated Third Lanark to lift the trophy, having played no part in their winning runs in the two previous campaigns. During that fairly brief time when he was a first-choice at Rangers, Cheyne was selected once for the Scottish Football League XI in September 1936 and twice for the Glasgow FA's annual challenge match against Sheffield (November 1936, September 1937).In May 1939 Cheyne moved on to Motherwell, but the outbreak of World War II shortly thereafter meant he never played officially for the club in the three years he was contracted there.

{"title": "Dermatophyte", "content": "Dermatophyte (from Greek \u03b4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1  derma \"skin\" (GEN \u03b4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 dermatos) and \u03c6\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd phyton \"plant\") is a common label for a group of fungus of Arthrodermataceae that commonly causes skin disease in animals and humans.  Traditionally, these anamorphic (asexual or imperfect fungi) mold genera are: Microsporum, Epidermophyton and Trichophyton. There are about 40 species in these three genera. Species capable of reproducing sexually belong in the teleomorphic genus Arthroderma, of the Ascomycota (see Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph for more information on this type of fungal life cycle). As of 2019 a total of nine genera are identified and new phylogenetic taxonomy has been proposed.Dermatophytes cause infections of the skin, hair, and nails, obtaining nutrients from keratinized material. The organisms colonize the keratin tissues causing inflammation as the host responds to metabolic byproducts. Colonies of dermatophytes are usually restricted to the nonliving cornified layer of the epidermis because of their inability to penetrate the viable tissue of an immunocompetent host. Invasion does elicit a host response ranging from mild to severe. Acid proteinases (proteases), elastase, keratinases, and other proteinases reportedly act as virulence factors. Additionally, the products of these degradative enzymes serve as nutrients for the fungi. The development of cell-mediated immunity correlated with delayed hypersensitivity and an inflammatory response is associated with clinical cure, whereas the lack of or defective cell-mediated immunity predisposes the host to chronic or recurrent dermatophyte infection.\nSome of these skin infections are known as ringworm or tinea (which is the Latin word for \"worm\"), though infections are not caused by worms. It is thought that the word tinea (worm) is used to describe the snake-like appearance of the dermatophyte on the skin. Toenail and fingernail infections are referred to as onychomycosis. Dermatophytes usually do not invade living tissues, but colonize the outer layer of the skin. Occasionally the organisms do invade subcutaneous tissues, resulting in kerion development.\n\n"}

Commonly referred to as \"hyalospheniids\", these lobose amoebae are characterized by their ability to generate a shell composed of either organic matter or siliceous particles that may be recycled from euglyphid amoebae. They inhabit soil or freshwater habitats, and are abundant on Sphagnum mosses.\nHyalospheniid amoebae originated after the middle Devonian, around 370 million years ago. They are considered important bioindicators, and are frequently used for environmental monitoring. Their fossils are studied to investigate the paleoecology of prehistoric wetland habitats. The classification of hyalospheniids has changed several times since the 19th century based on morphological criteria. Initially classified as two separate families, Hyalospheniidae and Nebelidae, they were later proven to be synonymous through phylogenetic analyses."}

Fort Simpson, a.k.a. Lax Kw'alaams), B.C.\nDudoward was a member of the Gitando tribe, one of the nine Tsimshian tribes based in Lax Kw'alaams. His mother was Mrs. Elizabeth Lawson (d. 1903), who held the hereditary name Diiks and was also known as Elizabeth Diex. Alfred was of mixed Native and white ancestry, his father having been F\u00e9lix Dudoire/Dudouaire, a French Canadian tailor in the employ of the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Simpson. He succeeded to his maternal uncle Paul Sgagweet's hereditary name-title Sgagweet in 1887 upon his uncle's death, in accordance with the rules of matrilineal succession. This established him as chief of the Gitando tribe.\nIn 1871 Dudoward married Mary Catherine, later known as Kate Dudoward, who was the daughter of a Tsimshian mother and a non-Native customs officer named Holmes. Kate's mother had been killed the year before in an ambush en route from Victoria, B.C., to Lax Kw'alaams, where she had been traveling to assume a chieftainship for which there was no male heir. Kate assumed the chieftainship instead.\nDudoward's own mother Elizabeth Diex was referred to by one missionary as \"the mother of Methodism among the Tsimpshean tribes.\"  Diex was converted to Christianity in Victoria in 1873 during a mass revival targeting First Nations people for conversion. When her son, Alfred Dudoward, arrived in a large war canoe to express his displeasure at this mass conversion, he soon converted as well.\nAfter returning home, Kate and Alfred organized religious instruction in Lax Kw'alaams and lobbied the Methodist church to establish a mission there, which they eventually did, in 1874 under the Rev. Thomas Crosby. In fact, it was the Dudowards who agitated for the Methodist church to establish a mission there.\nRepeated conflicts between traditionalism and Christianity led Crosby to suspend the Dudowards' membership in the church several times, until finally the Dudowards quit and joined the Salvation Army in 1895.\nDudoward had no (matrilineal) heirs and so adopted his own son and a niece into the House of Sgagweet in order to perpetuate the line. The son inherited the name Sgagweet and held it in 1938, when the anthropologist Viola Garfield recorded the house's order of succession. He had designated the niece's son as his successor.\nHis children included the carver Charles Dudoward."}

{"title": "All Saints' Church, Huntingdon", "content": "All Saints' Church is a Church of England church located in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, England. There have been multiple churches on the site of this one.  The earliest mention of a church dates to 973 AD with the original dedication having been to either St Mary, or The Blessed Virgin and All Martyrs.The chancel is Early English Period, but the main structure is in the Late Perpendicular Gothic style, dating from about the reign of Henry VII, and rebuilt in 1620. It was restored under the direction of Sir George Gilbert Scott when new oak roofs were added, and the old carving, retained wherever possible, or faithfully reproduced. It consists of chancel, nave, aisles, south porch and a western tower of Perpendicular era, containing four bells. There are several stained windows, a pulpit of carved alabaster around which runs an elaborate railing of metal work, in which a combination of copper, brass and tin has been used, the whole resting on a stone base. The font is of carved stone supported on columns of jasper, Irish and foreign marbles. There is a large organ with three rows of keys and containing between thirty and forty stops. The stalls are of carved oak, interspersed with walnut and cedar. A reredos of carved oak, enriched with figures, niches and canopies, was erected in the 1800s. The vestry was enlarged and ornamented with caning. The church has seating for about 500 persons.The registers of the parish of St John Baptist, brought here at the demolition of the church of that name, date from 1585; those of All Saints are from 1558. The celebrated entry of the baptism of Oliver Cromwell occurs in the register of St John's under the date of 1599, and there is a mention, about twenty years later, of his having done penance for some improper conduct.

He previously served as the 26th Prime Minister of Turkey from 1983 to 1989 as the leader of the Motherland Party. He was the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey in the military government of B\u00fclend Ulusu between 1980 and 1982.\nAfter working briefly at the World Bank in the United States and as a university lecturer, \u00d6zal became the general secretary and later the leader of the main miners' trade union of Turkey in 1979, serving as a chief negotiator during large-scale industrial action in 1977. He unsuccessfully stood for Parliament in the 1977 general election as a National Salvation Party (MSP) candidate from \u0130zmir. In 1979, he became an undersecretary to Prime Minister S\u00fcleyman Demirel's minority government until the 1980 military coup. As an undersecretary, he played a major role in developing economic reforms, known as the '24 January decisions,' which paved the way for greater neoliberalism in the Turkish economy. After the coup, he was appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey responsible for the economy in B\u00fclend Ulusu's government and continued to implement economic reforms. He resigned in 1982 following disagreements over economic policy.\u00d6zal formed the Motherland Party (ANAP) in 1983 after the ban on political parties was lifted by the military government. ANAP won a parliamentary majority in the 1983 general election and \u00d6zal subsequently became the Prime Minister of Turkey. While implementing several economic reforms concerning the exchange rate and deregulation, a rise in inflation and the growing conflict with Kurdish separatists led to ANAP winning reduced pluralities in the 1984 local elections. Despite a referendum in 1987 allowing politicians banned during the 1980 coup to resume political activities, ANAP was re-elected with a parliamentary majority in the 1987 general election, albeit with a reduced share of the vote. He survived an assassination attempt during a party congress in 1988. \u00d6zal's foreign policy focused on averting war with Greece following the \u015eim\u015fek Incident and temporarily allowed Bulgarian Turks to emigrate to Turkey.\n\u00d6zal was elected President of the Turkish Republic in the 1989 presidential election, while Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Akbulut replaced him as Prime Minister. Despite assuming a ceremonial role with minimal political duties, \u00d6zal remained occupied with government activities, such as intervening in the 1990 Zonguldak miners' strikes. While Akbulut took a docile approach as Prime Minister, disputes over the President's and Prime Minister's duties were dominant when S\u00fcleyman Demirel became Prime Minister after the 1991 general election. The Southeastern Anatolia development project began with the construction of the Atat\u00fcrk Dam in \u015eanl\u0131urfa, while \u00d6zal participated in the first ever summit of Turkic Republics in 1992 held in Ankara. He maintained close relations with the President of the United States George H. W. Bush during the Gulf War and the end of the Cold War. \u00d6zal died unexpectedly while in office in 1993, with an exhumation in 2012 leading to evidence of poisoning but the cause of death was unclear."}

{"title": "Biastophilia", "content": "Biastophilia (from Greek biastes, \"rapist\" + -philia) and its Latin-derived synonym raptophilia (from Latin rapere, \"to seize\"), also paraphilic rape, is a paraphilia in which sexual arousal is dependent on, or is responsive to, the act of assaulting an unconsenting person, especially a stranger. Some dictionaries consider the terms synonymous, while others distinguish raptophilia as the paraphilia in which sexual arousal is responsive to actually raping the victim.The source of the arousal in these paraphilias is the victim's terrified resistance to the assault, and in this respect it is considered to be a form of sexual sadism.Under the name paraphilic coercive disorder, this diagnosis was proposed for inclusion in DSM-5.  This diagnosis, under the name paraphilic rapism, was proposed and rejected in the DSM-III-R. It has been criticized because of the impossibility of reliably distinguishing between paraphilic rapists and non-paraphilic rapists, and because of this diagnosis, under the term Paraphilia NOS (not otherwise specified), non-consent had been used in Sexually Violent Person/Predator commitment.A standard concept in Czechoslovakian sexology is pathologic sexual aggressivity instead. This term is strongly distinguished from sadism. This disorder is understood as a coordination anomaly of the sexual motivation system (SMS), a \"courtship disorder\" according to Kurt Freund or displacement paraphilia by John Money, or a missing segment of SMS."}

In earlier eras, when information was scarce and access to information was power, organizations structured themselves along chains of power and authority, with those higher in the organization having more knowledge and therefore more power.

It lies at an elevation of 2,894 feet (882 meters) in Second Garrotte Basin.The town was named after a nearby hanging tree, where according to local lore as many as thirty men were said to have been hanged. Certain contemporary accounts from miners and settlers in the area suggest only two men were hung at Second Garrotte, a pair of thieves caught stealing gold dust from a sluice box. John Chaffee and Jason Chamberlain, early settlers at Second Garrotte who owned the property on which the hanging tree stood, denied any hangings took place.The nearby town of Groveland was originally known as First Garrotte, named after an earlier hanging at that town.The historical location of Second Garrote is at 20450 Old State Route 120, 2.4 miles Southeast of Groveland.

{"title": "Sheck Exley", "content": "Sheck Exley (April 1, 1949 \u2013 April 6, 1994) was an American cave diver. He is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of cave diving, and he wrote two major books on the subject: Basic Cave Diving: A Blueprint for Survival and Caverns Measureless to Man. On February 6, 1974, Exley became the first chairman of the Cave Diving Section of the American National Speleological Society. During his career, he established many of the basic safety procedures used in cave and overhead diving today. Exley was also a pioneer of extreme deep scuba diving.For purposes of rescue during cave diving, Exley helped standardize the usage of the \"octopus\", a redundant second stage diving regulator that can be used as a backup in the event the diver's primary second stage fails, or alternatively, to allow the diver and their buddy to have simultaneous access to the diver's gas if the buddy has an out-of-gas emergency. The octopus is now considered an essential piece of equipment among virtually all scuba divers, whether caving or in open water.Exley died at age 45 while trying to set a depth record by diving the world's deepest sinkhole, Mexico's 1,080-foot (330 m) deep, Zacat\u00f3n, a fresh water cenote.In the book, Diving into Darkness (a story about Dave Shaw and Don Shirley), the author comments: \"Exley's status in the sport is almost impossible to overstate\"."}

The Russian Paralympic Committee appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, but both bodies upheld the IPC's decision. IPC president Philip Craven stated that Russia's actions had demonstrated a failure in its obligations to comply with established anti-doping protocols.On 9 December 2016, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren published the second part of his independent report. The investigation found that from 2011 to 2015, more than 1,000 Russian competitors in various sports (including summer, winter, and Paralympic sports) benefited from the cover-up. Emails indicate that they included five blind powerlifters, who may have been given drugs without their knowledge, and a fifteen-year-old.\n\n"}

Brace design contributes significantly to the type of sound a guitar will produce. According to luthiers W. Cumpiano and J. Natelson, \"By varying brace design, each builder has sought to produce a sound that conformed to his concept of the ideal.\"The back of the instrument is braced to help distribute the force exerted by the neck on the body, and to maintain the tonal responsiveness and structural integrity of the sound box."}

Barrie's 1904 play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up with music and lyrics by Leonard Bernstein; it opened on Broadway on April 24, 1950.  This version starred Jean Arthur as Peter Pan, Boris Karloff in the dual roles of George Darling and Captain Hook, and Marcia Henderson as Wendy. The show was orchestrated by Trude Rittmann and Hershy Kay and conducted by Benjamin Steinberg. The show ran for 321 performances, closing on January 27, 1951.The production was initially intended as a full-blown musical, with Bernstein composing a complete score for it, but was staged with only five songs \u2013 \"Who Am I?\", \"Pirate's Song\", \"Plank Round\", \"Build My House\", and \"Peter Peter\" \u2013 to accommodate the limited vocal ranges of the principals.In 1998, conductor Alexander Frey began research into whether there may have existed more material that Bernstein had composed for Peter Pan. Over the next seven years, as his schedule allowed, he discovered and restored almost an hour of previously unheard music, much of the material found (and not yet orchestrated) in the archives of the composer's manuscripts. The restored songs included \"Captain Hook Soliloquy\" and \"Dream With Me\", as well as other sung material, dance music and orchestral interludes. The world premiere recording of Bernstein's complete score was released on CD in 2005, conducted by Alexander Frey, and featuring Broadway star Linda Eder in the role of Wendy Darling, and acclaimed baritone Daniel Narducci as Captain Hook, on the Koch International Classics label.In December 2006, it was produced for the stage by The King's Head Theatre in Islington, London, with Katherine Kastin as Peter Pan, Peter Land as Captain Hook, and Rafaella Hutchinson as Tinker Bell, directed by Stephanie Sinclaire and featuring new musical arrangements by Mike Dixon. This production used only parts of the Bernstein score and none of the original orchestrations. The music was performed by an instrumental trio.\nIn September 2008 the world premiere performance of the full Bernstein score was performed in concert with Alexander Frey conducting the Gulbenkian Orchestra, with dialogue adapted from the original J. M. Barrie play by Nina Bernstein Simmons. Three performances were given in Cascais, Portugal, for a combined audience of over 10,000 people, and featured Geraldine James (narrator), John Sackville-West (Peter Pan), Charlotte Ellett and Rachel Nicholls (Wendy) and Nicholas Lester (Captain Hook).\nThe first stage production of the full Bernstein score was given by Santa Barbara Theater (California) in December 2008, directed by Albert Ihde with a full orchestra again conducted by Alexander Frey.\nAnother production was held at the Richard B.

They are located in Wuze Town, an indoor area of the park.\nThe rides consist of two similar tracks which mirror each other at first but also feature some unique sections. The cars seat four people, two facing backwards, and freely spin after the first drop. In theory, this would mean every single ride would spin in a unique pattern. However, several sections of track are designed to make optimal use of the car's momentum, forcing the car to move in certain ways.\nThe two roller coasters are raised via a vertical lift instead of the traditional lifthill. The Winjas feature a unique hinged section of track about halfway through, with Fear collapsing forward and Force banking sideways in order to continue. The two coasters travel on separate tracks and are intertwined in the main hall of Wuze Town. At the very end of the ride, a little surprise element is built in, which shortly drops a section of track a few feet and raises it again.\nThe ride is themed to fit the Wuze Town environment, a fictional town of myths and fantasy. The character Winja after whom the rides are named, is the main character of the area. A soundtrack specially written for the Winja's can be heard in the queuing area. Two samples of the soundtrack for the 2000 Disney film Dinosaur are also used during the ride, respectively the lift and hinged sections."}

{"title": "Chief Government Architect of the Netherlands", "content": "The Chief Government Architect (Dutch: Rijksbouwmeester) is the senior architect for the Dutch Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM). The Chief Architect's responsibility is to protect and stimulate the architectural quality and urban suitability of government buildings in the Netherlands. The position was previously known as Chief National Architect (landsbouwmeester) and Royal Chief Architect (rijksarchitect).The Chief Architect provides an architect's view in urban planning projects and national, architectural policy. The architect is authorized to advise the government on relevant issues, either at the request of the government or of his own accord. The idea is also that he will pay special attention and act as a sort of guardian for monuments and other buildings of value as cultural heritage, as well as the use of visual art in government buildings.\nThe Chief Architect is officially the chief advisor to the Director-General of the Rijksgebouwendienst, the agency within VROM that manages government buildings. He is also the chief advisor for architectural policy to the ministers of VROM, of Housing, Neighborhoods and Integration and other ministers with responsibilities in this policy area. He is the head of his own staff bureau, the Chief Architect's Studio (Dutch: Atelier Rijksbouwmeester), which assists him in his duties. Starting in 2005 the Studio also houses three other policy advisors with similar tasks: the Government Advisor on Landscape, the Government Advisor on Infrastructure and the Government Advisor on Cultural Heritage. The four together are the College of Government Advisors.\nThe Chief Architect has great influence on urban building projects, as he decides which architects are allowed to bid on projects of the Rijksgebouwendienst.\nThe position of Chief Government Architect of the Netherlands has existed, under one name or another, since 1806. In that year Jean-Thomas Thibault was first named Royal Architect. The position was not unique between 1870 and 1920 as several Master Builders held the title simultaneously, each working for a different government service doing some sort of construction. After the formation of the Rijksgebouwendienst in 1924, only one Chief Architect position remained and he was in charge of the actual design work for government building. This changed to the current advisory position in the period 1958-1971, when Jo Vegter was Chief Architect. Following the new definition of the office (which was more neutral), the requests for the Chief Architect's involvement increased. During the 1980s his responsibilities were increased as well and finally it became necessary to create the other three Government Advisorships, to deal with the glut of work.\nIn 1998 a similar position was created in Flanders, the Flemish Government Architect."}
{"title": "HDMS Danmark", "content": "Danmark was an armored frigate of the Royal Danish Navy originally ordered by the Confederate States Navy.\nThe origins of the Danmark lie in efforts of the Confederate States of America to purchase warships in Europe, which is to say in the United Kingdom and France, during the American Civil War. These efforts were led by James Dunwoody Bulloch, but the Danmark was ordered by another Confederate agent, Lieutenant (later Commander) James H. North.\nNorth was sent to Europe by Confederate Navy secretary Stephen Mallory with the aim of buying a completed sea-going ironclad warship, the French Navy's Gloire, and ordering a similar vessel on Confederate account. The French government refused to sell Gloire, or to allow a sister ship to be built in French shipyards.\nNorth proceeded to Britain, where the Whig government had adopted a laissez-faire attitude to American arms-buying. Here he met with George Thomson, co-owner of the Clydebank shipbuilders J. & G. Thompson. North signed a contract with Thomson's on 21 May 1862 for an armoured frigate of some 3,000 tons and 80 metres in length, for a contract price of 190,000 pounds sterling\u2014around two million Confederate dollars at the prevailing rate of exchange\u2014paying a deposit of 18,000 pounds. Thomson's contracted to the deliver the ship by 1 June 1863.\nKnown to the Confederates as \"North's ship\", or as \"Number 61\", she was Santa Maria to her builders. As finally completed, she displaced 4,750 tons, a slab-sided three-masted barque. Under steam, she would make 8 knots (15 km/h; 9.2 mph).\nBy the summer of 1863, the Confederate agents in Europe were seeking to sell off North's ship,  offering her to the Imperial Russian Navy. The ship was clearly unsuited to Confederate needs, being too large and requiring too large a crew for their limited resources, and her draft of 6 metres was too deep for operations in the shoal waters on the Confederate coasts. Thompson's too were concerned that they would not be allowed to deliver the ship to the Confederates in the changed political climate and cancelled the contract in late 1863.\nWork continued slowly on the ship, which was launched on 23 February 1864. The outbreak of the Second War of Schleswig led the Royal Danish Navy to purchase the ship, but delays in fitting out and working up meant that she was not ready for service before the end of the war.\nThe Danmark undertook only one active commission, from June to October 1869. At sea with her armament aboard she rolled violently, and the coal consumption of her engines was extremely high. As a result, she remained in reserve thereafter, becoming a barracks ship in 1893 before being eventually scrapped in 1907.\nAs commissioned into Danish service, she was armed with 20 60-pounder (8-inch) smoothbore muzzle-loading guns of 88 hundredweight and 8 18-pounder rifled muzzle-loading guns of 40 hundredweight. In 1865 this was changed to an all-rifled muzzle-loading armament of 12 60-pounder guns and 10 24-pounder guns. Two more 24-pounder guns were added in 1867."}

MacQueen was requested to attend a \"Tainchel\" (a gathering to drive the country) at a tryst above Fi-Giuthas. In the morning, the Tainchel had long been assembled, though MacQueen was not initially present. When he arrived, MacQueen received a tirade of insulting comments for his delay, to which he asked \"Ciod e a' chabhag?\" (what was the hurry?). MacQueen lifted his plaid and produced the severed head of the wolf, tossing it in the middle of the surprised circle. MacQueen described to the assembly how he achieved the feat;\n\n\"As I came through the slochd (ravine) by east the hill there, I foregathered wi' the beast. My long dog there turned him. I bucked wi' him, and dirkit him, and syne whuttled his craig (cut his throat), and brought awa' his countenance for fear he might come alive again, for they are very precarious creatures.\n\nThe chief rewarded him, giving him a land called Sean-achan \"to yield good meat for his good greyhounds in all time coming\".

It is followed by three surfaces, one at 300 m a.s.l., another at 200 m and then the South Sm\u00e5land peneplain. There have been attempts at describing the southern portion of the Scandinavian Mountains as having a piedmonttreppen topography made up of paleic surfaces in the uplands and a strandflat at sea level. This idea has been strongly contested by Olaf Holtedahl. Later authors also stress that the Scandinavian Mountains cannot be described as a series of domes."}

He moved to Israel at the age of eight and lived with his family in the city of Lod. Epstein received his first publishing contract from Zamora-Bitan when he was only 23.  He has since published three novels and eight collections of stories in Hebrew, as well as numerous pieces in English-language journals including Ploughshares, The Kenyon Review, Guernica, JuxtaProse Literary Magazine, Zeek, Electric Literature, The Guardian, and The Collagist. His translations in Electric Literature were illustrated by renowned Israeli artist and animator, David Polonsky. Epstein has twice received the Israeli Prime Minister's Prize for Authors and Poets (2003; 2016). Epstein lives in Tel Aviv and has served as a writer-in-residence for the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa, and as a Schusterman Family Foundation Artist-in-Residence at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado (2010). In 2010 he took part of the PEN World Voices Festival in New York, he was featured in a panel with other writers such as Claire Messud, Lorraine Adams, Norman Rush, Yiyun Li and Aleksandar Hemon.Alex Epstein's very brief stories (some of them as short as one sentence) have been described as examples of the \"philosophical, or allegorical short-short story\", one of the primary types of short story common to contemporary Hebrew writing.  In a National Post review of Epstein's second English-language collection, writer Ian McGillis said that Epstein's works invited comparison to both \"contemporary McSweeney's-style pranksters and the august lineage of Kafka, Borges and Bruno Schulz\". Likewise, The Forward named Epstein \"Israel's Borges.\" Epstein's work has been translated into numerous languages, including English, French, Portuguese and Russian. American publisher Clockroot Books published two translated collections of his work, Blue Has No South (2010) and Lunar Savings Time (2011).  His second collection was widely and well-reviewed in Publishers Weekly, Three Percent, The Millions, Words Without Borders, and elsewhere. An experimentalist both in terms of narrative and format, Epstein's literature app \"True Legends\" was made available in 2014 and reviewed by the LA Times.  Israel's premier daily newspaper, Haaretz, regularly publishes his stories under the title \"Ktsartsarim\" (short-shorts). The English Haaretz has also featured his work.  His microfiction has been the subject of at least one peer-reviewed academic article in Shofar (2015), \"The Shape of Time in Microfiction: Alex Epstein and the Search for Lost Time.\""}

The 32 seats of Class 3 were contested in regular elections, and special elections were held to fill vacancies.\nWith the Hoover administration widely blamed for the Great Depression, Republicans lost twelve seats and control of the chamber to the Democrats, who won  28 of the 34 contested races (two Democratic incumbents, Duncan U. Fletcher of Florida and John H. Overton of Louisiana, were re-elected unopposed). Democrats gained another seat through an appointment in Nebraska, bringing their total number of seats up to 60. \nAmong the Republican incumbents defeated in 1932 were Senate Majority Leader James Watson and five-term Senator Reed Smoot, an author of the controversial Smoot-Hawley tariff. This was the first of four elections in which a Senate leader lost re-election, and the only time they were a Republican. This election marked the first time a woman was elected to the Senate, that being Hattie Caraway of Arkansas. As of 2023, this is the last time Democrats won a Senate election in Kansas.\nThis is also one of only five occasions where 10 or more Senate seats changed hands in an election, with the other occasions being in 1920, 1946, 1958, and 1980."}

{"title": "Akdamut", "content": "Akdamut, or Akdamus or Akdamut Milin, or Akdomus Milin (Jewish Babylonian Aramaic: \u05d0\u05b7\u05e7\u05b0\u05d3\u05b8\u05de\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea \u05de\u05b4\u05dc\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05df \u02beaqd\u0101m\u00fb\u1e6f mill\u00een \"In Introduction to the Words,\" i.e. to the Ten Commandments), is a prominent piyyut (\"liturgical poem\") written in Aramaic recited annually on the Jewish holiday of Shavuot by Ashkenazi Jews. It was penned by Rabbi Meir bar Yitzchak (the Nehorai) of Orl\u00e9ans, who was a cantor (prayer leader) in Worms, Germany, (died ca. 1095). Akdamut consists of praise for God, His Torah, and His people.\nAkdamut is read in almost all Ashkenazi synagogues on the first day of Shavuot during the Torah reading. The original practice was for it to be recited after the reading of the first verse (Exodus 19:1), but in the past few centuries, the practice has developed in many congregations (mainly Eastern European ones) that the poem is read after the kohen has been called to the Torah reading, but before he recites the blessing.\nThe reason for the original practice was that, from Biblical times to well into medieval times, each verse of the Torah reading in Hebrew would be followed by its interpretation into Aramaic, and therefore it would be appropriate, after the first Hebrew verse was read, for another reader to provide an Aramaic gloss including this \"introduction\".  However, when the simultaneous Aramaic interpretation fell into disuse, the recitation of Akdamut remained between the first and second Hebrew verses, where it no longer seemed an appropriate interruption, so it was relocated to before the commencement of the Torah reading.In most synagogues it is read responsively: the baal keriah (Torah reader) singing two verses, and the congregation responding with the next two verses. Although it is considered \"Judaism's best-known and most beloved piyyut\", there are some synagogues where it is not recited.Its adoption into the regular liturgy took some time; it is not mentioned as part of the Shavuot liturgy until the first decade of the 15th century and the earliest prayerbook to contain it was published in 1557.  Some say that it replaced an earlier piyyut, Arkin Moshe, which was a folkloric poem describing the excitement among the angels when  God brought Moses up to Heaven to receive the Ten Commandments, but both piyyutim appear alongside each other in many manuscripts and printed machzorim. The adoption of Akdamut into the liturgy may have been assisted by a folktale that connected its composition with a miraculous event involving the defeat of an evil sorcerer monk who was using magic to kill countless Jews."}

{"title": "First American National Bank", "content": "First American National Bank was a subsidiary of First American Corporation, a financial institution based in Nashville, Tennessee, that served the states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia and Virginia. It was headquartered in the First American Center in downtown Nashville.\nThe bank began, in Nashville, as the American National Bank and later (1930), merged with James E. Caldwell's Fourth and First National Bank, to become First American National Bank.  In 1971, construction of the First American Center (now the UBS Tower) in downtown Nashville resulted in the discovery of the skeleton of a sabertooth cat (Smilodon floridanus) within a cave beneath the bedrock. First American National Bank facilitated archaeological excavations at the site, funded radiocarbon analysis of the bone, and altered their original building design to protect the remnants of the cave, which still exist beneath the lower level of the building's parking garage. The cave is known variously as the \"First American Cave\" or by its official state archaeological site number, 40DV40. In 1997, the Smilodon skeleton from the First American site was the source for the logo of the Nashville Predators hockey team and the inspiration for their mascot, Gnash.Its name and logo disappeared in December 2000 when it was acquired by AmSouth Bancorporation, an institution based in Birmingham, Alabama, that was slightly smaller in size. First American had operated as a fully owned subsidiary of AmSouth for most of 2000. First American was sold after a series of unprofitable mergers, including one with Jackson, Mississippi-based Deposit Guaranty Bank that proved to be a hurdle the corporation could not clear financially. Deposit Guaranty was fully integrated into First American, but kept its name. This allowed FANB to gain significant market share in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana, though it did not operate these branches under the corporate brand, nor under recent the Iowa purchaser.First American's demise ended Nashville's storied history as a strong financial center. It, along with Third National Bank (now a part of SunTrust) and Commerce Union Bank (now a part of Bank of America), was once involved in a tight three-way battle for market share that ultimately helped all three banks expand well beyond their respective bounds. When the resources of the three could no longer stand the rapid expansion and numerous acquisitions, they all succumbed and merged with other banks. FANB, the largest of these three banks, was the only one to fold itself into a smaller institution. As of 2007, Nashville is still home to several local banks, but most do not exist outside of Davidson County.\nUntil 2005, AmSouth Bank continued First American's former tradition of having the highest market share in Nashville, however it was surpassed by SunTrust after its acquisition of Memphis-based National Commerce Financial. In 2006, however, AmSouth reclaimed the distinction of largest market share in metropolitan Nashville. In 2006-2007, AmSouth merged with Regions Financial Corporation which is headquartered in Birmingham. The newly combined bank retained Nashville's largest market share [1] in addition to AmSouth's CEO, C. Dowd Ritter continuing as CEO of the company."}

{"title": "DZI (company)", "content": "DZI [\u02ccd\u025bz\u025b\u02c8i], an acronym for State Insurance Institute (Bulgarian: \u0414\u044a\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442, Darzhaven zastrahovatelen institut) is a Bulgarian company primarily engaged in various forms of insurance. \nOn June 27, 1946, Bulgaria passed a law providing for the nationalisation of insurance companies and for a state monopoly on insurance business. Based on this law, all assets and liabilities of the existing public and cooperative insurance companies, mutual insurance funds, insurance departments of banks etc. are transferred to the State Insurance Institute (DZI). All valid insurances and portfolios, debts, as well as reinsurance contracts preserved their validity and were transferred by rights to DZI. By this act, effectively, DZI merged the active insurance companies into a bigger one. The state insurance control also ended its activity because the functions of the insurance control were transferred to DZI too.\nDZI was created by this law as an autonomous company, juridical entity, with headquarters in Sofia and with a complex structure, functioning in this way until 1952 when the establishment of branches and gradual decentralisation of the Institutes activity began.\nDZI functioned as the only insurance company in Bulgaria until 1961 when a government decree established the Bulgarian foreign insurance and reinsurance company \u201cBulstrad,\u201d founded on the then existing department within the DZI. The main shareholder in \u201cBulstrad\u201d was the Finance Ministry and one of the principal shareholders was DZI itself. \u201cBulstrad\u201d  dealt with all insurance contracts related to obligations outside of the territory of the country \u2013 marine, aviation, tourist etc., while DZI kept its monopoly over insurance business inside the country.\nApart the monopoly on insurance, after 1946 the State gradually raised the relative share of compulsory (by law) insurance. The Law for Property insurance was voted in 1958 and the modifications of 1969 enlarged considerably the range of compulsory property insurance.\nThe juridical monopoly on insurance has been kept strictly until 1989, when started real competition in insurance. Should be noticed, that although some of the names coincided, the newly created insurance companies were by no means successors of those existing before 1946.\nThe rise of the new situation in the business was a challenge for DZI, which successfully transformed itself to market conditions and kept its pre-eminent position thanks to excellent performance and the offering of insurance products of the highest standard. Together with its business development, the Company has collaborated actively for the establishment of an appropriate insurance legislation and was among the co-founders of the Bulgarian insurers association in 1992.\nIn October 1998 DZI was transformed into a public company with 100% state ownership. On 7 December 1999 in the \u201cState Gazette\u201d, issue 107 was published the decision of the Privatisation Agency to open a procedure for privatisation of the \u201cState Insurance Institute \u2013 DZI\u201d Plc. which ended with the sale of the company on 27 August 2002 to Emil Kyulev\u2019s \u201cContract Sofia\u201d Ltd.\nOn 10 October 2002 at the shareholders\u2019 General Meeting was taken the decision to rename the \u201cState Insurance Institute \u2013 DZI\u201d Plc. to \u201cDZI\u201d Plc.\nOn 21 December 2006, Eurobank EFG acquired over 90% of DZI's banking division, which was merged into Postbank in the third quarter of 2007.\nOn 3 August 2007 KBC received all needed approval\u2019s documents from regulations authorities and successfully finalised the acquisition of DZI with total amount of the acquired shares reaching 80,457%. \nDZI is headquartered in a six-storey landmark building in the centre of Sofia built 1914-1926 by architect G. Fingov.[1]"}

It should not be confused with the folk revival group Jil Jilala.\nThe Jilala are the oldest Moroccan Muslim confraternity, named after the Sufi master Abdul Qadir Gilani, in Morocco called Moulay Abdelkader Jilali or Boualam Jilali (B\u016b 'alam Jilali).The rituals of Jilala ranging the dhikr and invocation of marabouts and jinns, just like the other tranche confraternity of Morocco (Gnawa, Hmadsha and Aissawa).\nThe Jilala operate in small groups, usually less than five people. The musical instruments they use are the gasba flute (bamboo red flute) and bendir, those using bendir generally are also those who make the invocations and chants. When it comes to songs in honor of a type of spirits called buww\u0101b (black African jinn, traditionally associated to the Gnawa), some Jilala also use the krakebs, the typical large iron castanets of the Gnawa.Originally only a voice of sacred Moroccan sufism, and in their early repertoire, besides the invocation of saints and the jinn and the songs of praise of Allah, have a gripe songs of exile and death, and for this reason the musical style of this confraternity is melancholic. The Jilala Jilala music is all about throb and rasp. Throb - the acceleration and deceleration within a song, the breathy organic timbre of the gasba flutes, the in-and-out-of-phase frequencies of the paired flutes. Rasp - flutes, voices, bendirs, all buzzy. The bendir patterns inhabit the 2/4 and 6/8 universes common across Morocco, but I find the drum stroke patterns particularly loopy and provocative.They are called, behind monetary compensation, upon to exorcise evil spirits, to purify the heart and for curing to heal the sick (in particularly useful in curing cases of hysteria and depression), through the invocation of saints and spirits.\nIn a ritual Jilala the lila is performed. The therapy or exorcism must be repeated every year in the same period. It is thought that if the therapy is not renewed, the sick or possessed the same symptoms recur at the approach of the date corresponding to the first crisis. In the time that elapses between two lila, however, the symptoms disappear, or, at least, are kept under control.\nThe participants in the rituals, especially women, falling into a trance (hal), dancing wildly (jadba or jedba) to the rhythm of flutes and bendir. I fell into a trance can have different behavior, such as laughter, screams, cries. The Jilala have spread throughout Morocco (excluding Western Sahara), especially in the north and in the region of the city of Casablanca.There are similarities between the rituals of Jilala and other therapeutic-Moroccan musical groups with the phenomenon of Italian tarantism, for example the release and wild dance, the fact that the therapy has to be renewed each year, the fact that healers are musicians, and it gives a therapeutic value to the colors, the music and dance."}

{"title": "Kingdom of Crystal", "content": "The Kingdom of Crystal (Swedish: Glasriket, The glass realm) is a geographical area today containing a total of 14 glassworks in the municipalities of Emmaboda, Nybro, Uppvidinge, and Lessebo in southern Sweden. The two municipalities Emmaboda and Nybro belong to Kalmar County and Lessebo and Uppvidinge belong to Kronoberg County. The area is part of the province Sm\u00e5land, and Nybro is considered the capital of the Kingdom of Crystal area. The Kingdom of Crystal is known for its handblown glass with a continuous story since 1742. The glassworks have become part of the culture of Sweden; examples can be found in many Swedish homes, recognisable by a small sticker at the bottom with the name Orrefors, Kosta, etc. The height of glass production was the end of the 19th century during which 77 glass factories were established with more than half of them situated in Sm\u00e5land.When touring the forested province of Sm\u00e5land in Sweden, it is normal to visit at least one of the glassworks. The larger ones have adjacent museums and are open for visitors to see the glass blowing hall, normally looking down from a platform. Food is available as well as shopping for various glass products such as glasses, bowls, vases and unique glass ornaments. The Kingdom of Crystal is a popular and a well known tourist destination. The Regional Council of Kalmar County conducts a study every four years to survey the Swedish public regarding their knowledge and awareness about Kalmar County, its places to visit and tourist attractions. The survey was conducted by Kantar Sifo and included 1500 respondents aged 20\u201379 years old. The survey results found that the Kingdom of Crystal area was the most visited tourist attraction in the Kalmar County attracting a wide range of people. One in five aged 40\u201379 years old had visited the area in the last five years. The visitors had no significant difference in terms of geographical belonging, income or gender. The only difference that could be noted was that the group visiting the area tended to be of older age rather than young. Among the respondents aged 40\u201365+ years old only 3% claimed they never heard of the Kingdom of Crystal.The more notable are Orrefors Glasbruk, with the adjacent National School of Glass and Kosta Glasbruk, which is the basis for the Kosta Boda company. Each one of the glassworks have distinctive design traditions, character and atmosphere.\n\n"}

{"title": "Nu Centauri", "content": "Nu Centauri, Latinized from \u03bd Centauri, is a binary star system in the southern constellation of Centaurus. The combined apparent visual magnitude of the pair is +3.41, making this one of the brightest members of the constellation. Based upon parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, this star system is located at a distance of roughly 437 light-years (134 parsecs) from Earth. The margin of error for this distance is about 2%, which is enough to give an error in distance of \u00b110 light years.This is a single-lined spectroscopic binary system, which means that the two stellar components have not been individually resolved with a telescope. Instead, their orbital motion can be tracked through periodic shifts in the spectrum of the primary. The gravitational perturbation of the hidden secondary component upon the primary is causing the latter to first move toward and then away from the Earth, creating Doppler shift changes in the spectrum. From these subtle shifts, the orbital elements of the pair can be extracted. The pair are orbiting their common center of mass in a circular orbit with a period of only 2.622 days, indicating that they are in a relatively tight orbit.\nThe interaction between the two components of this system appears to be creating emission lines in the spectrum, turning the primary into a Be star. It has a stellar classification of B2 IV, which matches a massive B-type subgiant star. The primary has 8.5 times the mass of the Sun and 6.4 times the Sun's radius. It is a Beta Cephei type variable star with a brightness that periodically varies from magnitude +3.38 to +3.41 over an interval of 0.17 days. The tidal interaction with the secondary component has turned it into a rotating ellipsoidal variable.\nThis star system is a proper motion member of the Upper Centaurus\u2013Lupus sub-group in the Scorpius\u2013Centaurus OB association, the nearest such association of co-moving massive stars to the Sun."}

He worked for 14 years as a computer scientist at NASA Ames Research Center, and then from 1998 to 2013 as a Senior Scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He is now retired from the Berkeley Lab.\nBailey is perhaps best known as a co-author (with Peter Borwein and Simon Plouffe) of a 1997 paper that presented a new formula for \u03c0 (pi), which had been discovered by Plouffe in 1995.  This Bailey\u2013Borwein\u2013Plouffe formula permits one to calculate binary or hexadecimal digits of pi beginning at an arbitrary position, by means of a simple algorithm. Subsequently, Bailey and Richard Crandall showed that the existence of this and similar formulas has implications for the long-standing question of \"normality\"\u2014whether and why the digits of certain mathematical constants (including pi) appear \"random\" in a particular sense.\nBailey is a long-time collaborator with the late Jonathan Borwein (Peter's brother). They co-authored five books and over 80 technical papers on experimental mathematics.\nBailey also does research in numerical analysis and parallel computing. He has published studies on the fast Fourier transform (FFT), high-precision arithmetic, and the PSLQ algorithm (used for integer relation detection). He is a co-author of the NAS Benchmarks, which are used to assess and analyze the performance of parallel scientific computers. A \"4-step\" method of calculating the FFT is widely known as Bailey's FFT algorithm (Bailey himself credits it to W. M. Gentleman and G. Sande).  \nHe has also published articles in the area of mathematical finance, including a 2014 paper \"Pseudo-mathematics and financial charlatanism,\" which emphasizes the dangers of statistical overfitting and other abuses of mathematics in the financial field.\nIn 1993, Bailey received the Sidney Fernbach award from the IEEE Computer Society, as well as the Chauvenet Prize and the Hasse Prize from the Mathematical Association of America. In 2008 he was a co-recipient of the Gordon Bell Prize from the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2017 he was a co-recipient of the Levi L.

{"title": "A Short History of Ethics", "content": "A Short History of Ethics: A History of Moral Philosophy from the Homeric Age to the Twentieth Century is a 1966 book on the history of moral philosophy by the Scottish philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre. It is the first of a series of books by MacIntyre on the history and development of ethics.The book covers Greek ethics including Plato and Aristotle, Christian moral thought including the work of Martin Luther and writers including Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Montesquieu, Edmund Burke, Immanuel Kant, David Hume, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche. MacIntyre also discusses twentieth century philosophers including G. E. Moore, John Dewey and R. M. Hare.According to a review in The Journal of Philosophy, one of MacIntyre's primary theses in the book is that \"moral concepts change as social life changes\" and therefore philosophers who believe there is one subject of ethical inquiry are mistaken. A review in the British Journal of Educational Studies describes the book as a \"stimulating, if highly impressionistic, account of the history of ethics written from the point of view of his own convictions about the state of moral concepts\".In a review for The Philosophical Review, J. B. Schneewind describes the work as a \"brilliant and provocative book\" that is \"not so much a history of ethics as an essay about the history of ethics\". Schneewind criticises some elements of the book, noting the absence of any discussion of Henry Sidgwick and also noting MacIntyre's lack of references or bibliography or of careful exposition of some of the issues of interpretation in the history of ethics."}

{"title": "Health effects from noise", "content": "Noise health effects are the physical and psychological health consequences of regular exposure to consistent elevated sound levels. Noise from traffic, in particular, is considered by the World Health Organization to be one of the worst environmental stressors for humans, second only to air pollution. Elevated workplace or environmental noise can cause hearing impairment, tinnitus, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, annoyance, and sleep disturbance. Changes in the immune system and birth defects have been also attributed to noise exposure.Although age-related health effects (presbycusis) occur naturally with age, in many countries the cumulative impact of noise is sufficient to impair the hearing of a large fraction of the population over the course of a lifetime. Noise exposure has been known to induce noise-induced hearing loss, tinnitus, hypertension, vasoconstriction, and other cardiovascular adverse effects. Chronic noise exposure has been associated with sleep disturbances and increased incidence of diabetes. Adverse cardiovascular effects occur from chronic exposure to noise due to the sympathetic nervous system's inability to habituate. The sympathetic nervous system maintains lighter stages of sleep when the body is exposed to noise, which does not allow blood pressure to follow the normal rise and fall cycle of an undisturbed circadian rhythm.Stress from time spent around elevated noise levels has been linked with increased workplace accident rates, aggression, and other anti-social behaviors. The most significant sources are vehicles, aircraft, prolonged exposure to loud music, and industrial noise. Prolonged exposure to noise at home has been linked to decreased mental health.There are approximately 10,000 deaths per year as a result of noise in the European Union.\n\n"}

{"title": "Interserve", "content": "Interserve is a British construction and support services business based in Reading, Berkshire, which went into administration in 2019 and which is expected to be wound up in 2024. At that time, the group generated revenue of \u00a32.2 billion and had a workforce of 34,721 people.The company was founded in 1884 as the London and Tilbury Lighterage Company Limited. From 1991, it was known as Tilbury Douglas following a merger with RM Douglas, but in 2001 it rebranded as Interserve plc. The name change partly reflected a shift in focus during the 1990s towards maintenance and facilities management services sectors, and this continued in the 2000s, buoyed by further acquisitions.\nHowever, financial issues including problem contracts in Interserve's energy-from-waste business led to profit warnings in 2017. The company was forced to restructure and refinance in March 2018. After its financial situation worsened in late 2018, debt holders discussed further financial restructuring of the business. A debt-for-equity plan was rejected in March 2019, and Interserve plc went into administration owing creditors over \u00a3100m. In a pre-pack deal, the rest of the group was immediately sold to a newly incorporated company owned by lenders, Interserve Group Ltd, and a break-up of the company followed. Interserve's facilities management business was sold to Mitie in December 2020, and RMD Kwikform was sold in October 2021 to France's Altrad.\nIn March 2021, Interserve resurrected the Tilbury Douglas brand for its construction and engineering services businesses. Interserve plc was formally wound-up in the High Court in January 2022. In June 2022, Tilbury Douglas fully separated from Interserve Group and became a standalone construction contracting company. Some smaller assets are expected to be sold before Interserve Group is finally shut down in 2024. In October 2022, Interserve was fined \u00a34.4 million for a breach of data protection law in May 2020."}

Zhuang Ji flourished in the second century BCE as an early Han dynasty writer of literature and court attendant. He is notable for being one of the most published poets ever, due to having authored the piece \"Ai shi ming\", or \"Alas That My Lot Was Not Cast\", collected in the repeatedly re-published Chuci collection of verse: although just because Zhuang Ji's work was prolifically published as being included in a popular and early anthology does not necessarily mean that he has been notable for his poetic excellence. None of his other works are known to have survived. Zhuang Ji's biography is also sparse, although he is known to have been born in Wu state and later found refuge in Liang state. Both Wu and Liang were then semi-independent states, regions of the Han dynasty, directly controlled by their local ruler, in these two cases members of the royal house of Han. Zhuang Ji pursued a literary career, from which he attained his fame, though he seems to have at least initially made a living attending his local ruler's court, though in what function is unknown. During Zhuang Ji's life, political turmoil and social upheaval greatly informed his contributions to literature, indeed this kind of state of affairs is very evident in \"Ai shi ming\". THEREFORE Zhuang Ji aspired to eventually join the central imperial court of Han to further his career or literary pursuits is unknown; however, it is known that he found patronage in two different regional state courts, in his native Wu, and later in Liang, then a center of literary activity.

Technically, many of these materials are only vapor retarders as they have varying degrees of permeability.\nMaterials have a moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR) that is established by standard test methods. One common set of units is  g/m2\u00b7day or  g/100in2\u00b7day.  Permeability can be reported in perms, a measure of the rate of transfer of water vapor through a material (1.0 US perm = 1.0 grain/square-foot\u00b7hour\u00b7inch of mercury \u2248 57 SI perm = 57 ng/s\u00b7m2\u00b7Pa). American building codes have classified vapor retarders as having a water vapor permeance of 1 perm or less when tested in accordance with the ASTM E96 desiccant, or dry cup method.  Vapor-retarding materials are generally categorized as: \n\nImpermeable (\u22641 US perm, or \u226457 SI perm) \u2013 such as asphalt-backed kraft paper, elastomeric coating, vapor-retarding paint, oil-based paints, vinyl wall coverings, extruded polystyrene, plywood, OSB;\nSemi-permeable (1-10 US perm, or 57-570 SI perm) \u2013 such as unfaced expanded polystyrene, fiber-faced isocyanurate, heavy asphalt-impregnated building papers, some latex-based paints);\nPermeable (>10 US perm, or >570 SI perm) \u2013 such as unpainted gypsum board and plaster, unfaced fiber glass insulation, cellulose insulation, unpainted stucco, cement sheathings, spunbonded polyolefin or some polymer-based exterior air barrier films.\n\n"}
{"title": "City Rail Link", "content": "The City Rail Link (CRL) is a rail project currently under construction in Auckland, New Zealand.

Two new underground stations will be constructed to serve the city centre: Te Waihorotiu near Aotea Square and Karanga-a-Hape near Karangahape Road. Waitemat\u0101 will be converted from a terminus station into a through station, and Mount Eden station will be replaced by Maungawhau station, a new station with four platforms to serve as an interchange between the new CRL line and the existing Western Line.The current project is an adapted version of previous proposals to improve rail access to Auckland's city centre with the first proposals dating back to the 1920s. The increase in rail patronage in Auckland during the early 21st century, particularly after the opening of Britomart Transport Centre in 2003, led to renewed interest in the scheme. The 2012 Auckland Spatial Plan highlighted the CRL as the most important transport investment for Auckland and the project has enjoyed strong public support. Its planning and funding have also been the subject of controversy.In June 2013, the central government announced its support for the project with a construction commencement date of 2020, four years later than Auckland Council's preferred start date of 2016.

Robin Hawdon played Roger Scott, Finn's adjoining neighbour, a high-flying marketing executive and very much the polar opposite of Finn. Also appearing were Gillian Martell as Finn's wife Rose, and Julia Goodman as Roger's wife Amanda. The series, made by Thames Television, came on the back of the success of Crawford playing Frank Spencer in the BBC's hugely popular Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em.

However he claimed that audiences did not take to his character, and after an offer of another starring stage role, it was cancelled after only one series."}

It has particular significance for how one may interpret the nature of the quantum state.\nWith respect to certain realist hidden variable theories that attempt to explain the predictions of quantum mechanics, the theorem rules that pure quantum states must be \"ontic\" in the sense that they correspond directly to states of reality, rather than \"epistemic\" in the sense that they represent probabilistic or incomplete states of knowledge about reality.\nThe PBR theorem may also be compared with other no-go theorems like Bell's theorem and the Bell\u2013Kochen\u2013Specker theorem, which, respectively, rule out the possibility of explaining the predictions of quantum mechanics with local hidden variable theories and noncontextual hidden variable theories. Similarly, the PBR theorem could be said to rule out preparation independent hidden variable theories, in which quantum states that are prepared independently have independent hidden variable descriptions.\nThis result was cited by theoretical physicist Antony Valentini as \"the most important general theorem relating to the foundations of quantum mechanics since Bell's theorem\".\n\n"}

{"title": "Monazite geochronology", "content": "Monazite geochronology is a dating technique to study geological history using the mineral monazite. It is a powerful tool in studying the complex history of metamorphic rocks particularly, as well as igneous, sedimentary and hydrothermal rocks. The dating uses the radioactive processes in monazite as a clock.\nThe uniqueness of monazite geochronology comes from the high thermal resistance of monazite, which allows age information to be retained during the geological history. As monazite grows, it forms successive generations of different compositions and ages, commonly without erasing the previous ones, forming zonation patterns in monazite. Because of the age zonation, dating should be done on individual zones, rather than the whole crystal. Also, textures of monazite crystals may represent certain type of events. Therefore, direct sampling techniques with high spatial resolution are required, in order to study these tiny zones individually, without damaging the textures and zonations.The advantage of monazite geochronology is the ability to relate monazite compositions with geological processes. Finding the ages of compositional zones can mean finding the ages of geological processes.\n\n"}

{"title": "History of Manitoba", "content": "The history of Manitoba covers the period from the arrival of Paleo-Indians thousands of years ago to the present day. When European fur traders first travelled to the area present-day Manitoba, they developed trade networks with several First Nations. European fur traders in the area during the late-17th century, with the French under Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La V\u00e9rendrye set up several trading post forts. In 1670, Britain declared sovereignty over the watershed of Hudson's Bay, known as Rupert's Land; with the Hudson's Bay Company granted a commercial monopoly over the territory.\nAt the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, the French colony of New France was ceded to the British, ending any competition between European claims to the North-West. Traders from the Hudson's Bay Company expanded their operations to areas formerly occupied by French fur trading forts. In 1811, Lord Selkirk established the first agricultural settler colony in Rupert's Land, the Red River Colony, around the Red River of the North. In 1817 Saulteaux Chief Peguis and four other Chiefs of the Sauteaux and Cree Nations agreed to share land with Lord Selkirk and his settlers in the Peguis Selkirk Treaty. As a result of the Treaty of 1818 between the United Kingdom and the United States the 49th parallel north was established as the border between Rupert's Land and the United States; with areas south of the parallel being transferred to the United States. \nIn 1870, the Deed of Surrender was enacted, transferring Rupert's Land from the United Kingdom to Government of Canada, forming the North-West Territories. In response to the Red River Rebellion, the province of Manitoba was established around the lands of the Red River Colony. Canada started a process of Numbered Treaties with the First Nations to settle aboriginal title in the North-West and clear land for settlers. Manitoba is the first province created from the North-West Territories, and was subsequently expanded in 1881 and 1912 to its present boundaries. The economy was long based on farming, grains, cattle, and hay. The economy is now diversified due to urbanization."}

{"title": "Nannochoristidae", "content": "Nannochoristidae is a family of scorpionflies with many unusual traits. It is a tiny, relict family with a single extant genus, Nannochorista, with eight species occurring in New Zealand, southeastern Australia, Tasmania, Argentina and Chile. Due to the group's distinctiveness from other scorpionflies, it is sometimes placed in its own order, the Nannomecoptera. Some studies have placed them as the closest living relatives of fleas. Most mecopteran larvae are eruciform, or shaped like caterpillars. Nannochoristid larvae, however, are elateriform, and have elongated and slender bodies. The larvae are aquatic, which is unique among mecopterans. The larvae are predatory, hunting on the beds of shallow streams, primarily on the larvae of aquatic Diptera like chironomids.Fossils indicate that Nannochoristidae formerly had a wider distribution, being present in the Northern Hemisphere during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous.Some research suggests the nannochoristids are the only holometabolous insects with true larval compound eyes. All other eyed larvae have stemmata, which are structurally different from adult compound eyes with ommatidia. This is unusual, since most adult features are present as imaginal discs in larvae and not formed until pupation. The presence of compound eyes in nannochoristid larvae suggests the timing of the development of adult features can be initiated earlier in development, which has important implications for insect evolutionary development."}

It is directed by Jonathan Mostow and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, and Kristanna Loken. In its plot, the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet sends a T-X (Loken)\u2014a highly advanced Terminator\u2014back in time to ensure the rise of machines by killing top members of the future human resistance as John Connor's (Stahl) location is unknown. The resistance sends back a reprogrammed T-850 (Schwarzenegger) to protect John and Kate (Danes).\nWhile Terminator creator James Cameron was interested in directing the third film, he ultimately had no involvement with Terminator 3. Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar, who had produced Terminator 2: Judgment Day through their company Carolco Pictures, obtained the rights for the franchise through both Carolco's liquidation auction and negotiations with producer Gale Ann Hurd. In 1999, Tedi Sarafian was hired to write the first draft of the script. Mostow joined the project as director in 2001, and he brought on John Brancato and Michael Ferris to rewrite Sarafian's script. The $187 million budget included a $5 million salary for Mostow and a record $30 million salary for Schwarzenegger. Filming took place in California from April to September 2002. Industrial Light & Magic and Stan Winston created the special effects, as they did for the previous film.\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines premiered in Westwood, Los Angeles, on June 30, 2003, and was released on July 2, 2003, by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States and by Columbia TriStar Film Distributors International in worldwide territories.

{"title": "Axis naval activity in Australian waters", "content": "There was considerable Axis naval activity in Australian waters during the Second World War, despite Australia being remote from the main battlefronts.  German and Japanese warships and submarines entered Australian waters between 1940 and 1945 and attacked ships, ports and other targets. Among the best-known attacks are the sinking of HMAS Sydney by a German raider in November 1941, the bombing of Darwin by Japanese naval aircraft in February 1942, and the Japanese midget submarine attack on Sydney Harbour in May 1942. About 40 Allied merchant ships were damaged or sunk off the Australian coast by surface raiders, submarines and mines. Japanese submarines also shelled three Australian ports and submarine-based aircraft flew over several Australian capital cities.\nThe Axis threat to Australia developed gradually and until 1942 was limited to sporadic attacks by German armed merchantmen. The level of Axis naval activity peaked in the first half of 1942 when Japanese submarines conducted anti-shipping patrols off Australia's coast, and Japanese naval aviation attacked several towns in northern Australia. The Japanese submarine offensive against Australia was renewed in the first half of 1943 but was broken off as the Allies pushed the Japanese onto the defensive. Few Axis naval vessels operated in Australian waters in 1944 and 1945, and those that did had only a limited impact.\nDue to the episodic nature of the Axis attacks and the relatively small number of ships and submarines committed, Germany and Japan were not successful in disrupting Australian shipping. While the Allies were forced to deploy substantial assets to defend shipping in Australian waters, this did not have a significant impact on the Australian war effort or American-led operations in the South West Pacific Area."}

The depth of the gorge seems disproportionate to the size of the stream, as is typical of many of the streams of the plateau.  The erosive power of plateau streams is considerable because of the frequent and often intense rainfall in the area.  The Little Obed and its gorge are bridged by U.S. Highway 127 just north of Crossville; the Little Obed's confluence with the Obed River is slightly northwest of Crossville near the remains of a former bridge on an abandoned railroad that once linked Nashville and Knoxville."}

It operates schools and Yiddish education programs, and year-round programs of concerts, lectures and secular holiday celebrations. The organization has community branch offices throughout North America, a national headquarters in New York City.  \nFormed in 1900 by Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, The Workmen's Circle at first acted as a mutual aid society, helping its members to adapt to their new life in America. It provided life insurance, unemployment relief, healthcare, social interaction, burial assistance and general education through its branches throughout the US as well as through its national office.  Soon, the organization was joined by more politically focused socialist Bundists who advocated the anti-assimilationist idea of Yiddish cultural autonomy, led by education in Yiddish and socialist ideals. The Circle formed the Folksbiene Yiddish theatre troupe and promoted Jewish arts and music, Yiddish school programs for children and Yiddish summer camps. It became influential in the American labor movement and grew to serve more than 84,000 members through hundreds of branches around North America. It also became involved with the Yiddish newspaper The Forward and operated old-age homes, medical clinics and other services.\nPolitically, the Circle moved away from socialism towards liberalism by the time of the New Deal. By the 1960s, the Circle's membership began to decline, as Jews joined the middle class and moved from cities to suburbs; the Circle no longer seemed as essential to many as it had been. In the new century, the organization ended its direct health insurance program, streamlined its operations, separated from The Forward, and rededicated its mission to education and promoting Jewish community, secular Yiddish culture and social justice activism. It sold its former East side building and moved to new offices in the Garment District of New York City in 2011. The Workmen's Circle is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization."}

Analyses of DNA data indicated that the genus did not fit in any known plant family and not clearly in any then-recognized order, and a new family, Gerrardinaceae, was thus created for it. Later analyses of additional DNA data and data from wood anatomy  indicated that the family should be placed in the order Huerteales."}
